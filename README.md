# Background-Changer

## Remove background and replace it with our own custom background. 
### Process to use:
1. pip install all the required libraries, i.e., openCV, cvzone and mediapipe.
2. Open your code editor and just run the code.

### PS: If you want to add some custom background, just add the image in the images folder.
